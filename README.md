My simple HTML+jQuery Dashboard

A very simple project to create an HTML dashboard with a sprinkle of Javascript.

It uses jQuery for very simple stuff.
See site.json.example to create your own site.json.

Add more tipes of buttons by adding the style to site.css and under "style" in the site.json

add your images to /images.

that's it.
